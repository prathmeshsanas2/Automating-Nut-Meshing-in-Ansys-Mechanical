Automating Nut Meshing in Ansys Mechanical â€“ Saving Time & Standardizing Mesh Quality! ðŸ”©ðŸŽ¯
I recently developed a custom "Nut" button in Ansys Mechanical that automates the entire nut meshing process with just a single click! ðŸŽ‰
ðŸ”¹ What does it do?
 âœ… Automatically detects and classifies nuts based on size
 âœ… Applies standardized mesh settings for consistency
 âœ… Saves significant pre-processing time by eliminating manual meshing steps
With this automation, engineers can now focus on analysis rather than spending time on repetitive meshing tasks. This not only boosts efficiency but also ensures high-quality, consistent meshing across simulations.

It developed on the Pyprimemesh and pymechanical libraries of pyansys.

Here is the some short codes for reference.

def createNut(analysis):
    """
    The method is called when the toolbar button is clicked.

    Keyword arguments:
    analysis -- the active analysis
    """

    # Add the "Nut" ACT load as defined in the XML file in the selected analysis tree.
    analysis.CreateLoadObject("Nut", ExtAPI.ExtensionManager.CurrentExtension)

# named selection
# Step 1 create named selection by selecting all nuts and rename it as Nut

# Creating small and big nut named selection

sel = Model.AddNamedSelection()
sel.ScopingMethod = GeometryDefineByType.Worksheet
sel.Name = "smallnut"
Nut = sel.GenerationCriteria
Nut.Add(None)
Nut[0].EntityType = SelectionType.GeoBody
Nut[0].Criterion = SelectionCriterionType.NamedSelection
Nut[0].Operator = SelectionOperatorType.Equal
Nut[0].Value = DataModel.GetObjectsByName("Nut")[0]

Nut.Add(None)
Nut[1].Action = SelectionActionType.Filter
Nut[1].EntityType = SelectionType.GeoBody
Nut[1].Criterion = SelectionCriterionType.Size
Nut[1].Operator = SelectionOperatorType.LessThan
Nut[1].Value = Quantity("1600 [mm mm mm]")
sel.Generate()
